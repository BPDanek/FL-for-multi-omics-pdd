    "Utilizing machine learning in medical and scientific research has become extremely important as ML allows the analysis of large-scale data that humans need help with. ML requires large-scale datasets, and there's a massive demand to use multi-ancestry data for medical research. Still, it's a complex problem, as many countries and organizations have strict data-sharing regulations. These regulations are necessary to protect patients, so we need another safe way to conduct essential medical and scientific research. Federated Learning is one of the new emerging methods in machine learning to overcome this problem of limited data access. In the most basic terms, federated learning enables training machine learning models without the raw data leaving the origin system, allowing researchers worldwide to collaborate while ensuring the protection of patients' data."
